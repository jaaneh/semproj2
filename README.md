# Noroff - Semester Project 2

This is the GitHub repo for the Noroff Semester Project 2, where we were meant to create a Game of Thrones board game in JavaScript using the [An API of Ice And Fire API](https://anapioficeandfire.com/).

#### You can find the completed game hosted on my website [here](https://to.jaany.xyz/semproj2).
